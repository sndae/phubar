#summary Tail tuning -rate mode thru HH, with or without collective compensation


===Tuning the tail when using the 3D version of the software, currently in the SatelliteReceiver branch in SVN.===  

Rate mode with no collective compensation (collective feed-forward = 0)
  # Fly and trim rudder trim on tx until it hovers in trim
  # Land and mark where the trim position is with a magic marker
  # Recenter tx yaw trim
 
Rate mode with collective compensation
  # Set collective compensation at 50%
  # Recheck yaw center position is on the mark at hover collective position.  It will move slightly 
  # Readjust yaw center value until the mark lines up
  # Test fly and do collective manuvers to see witch way the tail kicks.
  # Adjust collective compensation until you get pretty much zero heading change with full collective (very headspeed dependent so setup for your average throttle curve)
 
HH mode
  # Turn on HH mode and test fly. Adjust HH gain as needed. You shouldn't see any weird behavior - it should lock the tail in nicely.
