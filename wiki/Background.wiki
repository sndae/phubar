The software uses five of the eight available cogs of the Propeller chip.

There is one body of code for both the 2-axis PhuBar2 and the 3-axis PhuBar3.  The file Constants.spin has a version switch that can be set to either 2 or 3 to select which code is invoked. 

Most of the components are surface-mount devices.  The ITG-3200 is a QFN chip 4mmx4mm square, requiring fine soldering tools and skills that may be beyond the average hobbyist. 

Discussion of the development of PhuBar2 and subsequent PhuBar3, with flight test videos, can be found in an RCGroups thread here:
