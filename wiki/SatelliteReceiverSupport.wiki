#summary Support for Spektrum Satellite receivers

The Phubar3 can be used with a Spektrum Satellite receiver if you make the following modifications:

    A separate 3-pin connector is needed to connect to the satellite receiver.  The power pin must be wired to the +3v output of the voltage regulator.  The signal and ground pins must be wired to the signal and ground pins of the aileron input port on the PhuBar3.

  The rudder input on the PhuBar3 is used as the throttle output to an ESC.  If your PhuBar3 has a 10k current limiting resistor on the signal pin, this may be too large a value for some ESCs to see the signal.  You will likely need to replace the resistor on the rudder signal pin with a 2.2kohm resistor, or just solder a 2.2k ohm resistor on top of the existing 10k resistor (in parallel with).

  As of version 3.5 of the code,  the presence of a satellite rx signal will be automatically detected, so there are no parameters to be changed.
