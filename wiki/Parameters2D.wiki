#summary Parameter Settings for Some Common R/C Helicopters

For software version 3.5 or earlier, which was suitable for 2D flying only.

Following are PhuBar3 parameter settings that have been shown to result in stable, controllable flight on various helicopters.  Some parameters are not show here because they are either a matter of personal preference, or are handled by the auto-setup features.  Gain settings can vary if the physical specs of your helicopter vary from those shown below.

  HBFP = HoneyBee FP with blades trimmed at trailing edge to increase headspeed
         The HBFP testing used a PhuBar2

  The Blade CP was flown with a PhuBar2

  The 14mm Main Rotor Pitch Arm Length on the CopterX 250SE results from having the link ball in the middle hole of the arm on the MicroHeli Flybarless Rotor Head
