==Parameter Settings for Some Common Helicopters==

=Under Construction=

Following are PhuBar3 parameter settings that have been shown to result in stable, controllable flight on various helicopters.  Some parameters are not show here because they are either a matter of personal preference, or are taken care of by the auto-setup features.  Gain settings can vary if the physical specs of your helicopter vary from those shown below.
