=*PhuBar*=

PhuBar is a platform for developing stabilizer devices for micro-sized R/C helicopters.  It is based on the Parallax Propeller processor and the ITG-3200 3-axis gyro chip.  It is not intended to be a UAV controller or inertial navigation unit.  It simply provides stabilization similar to that of a physical weighted flybar, making small helicopters easier to fly.

==*Features*==

 * Ultra-Lightweight – about 7.5 grams excluding cables.
 * Handles up to 3 swashplate servos plus tail servo, and up to 4 RX channels, Aileron, Elevator, Pitch(Aux), and Rudder.  Swash servos can be at any position on the swash.
 * Built-in CCPM mixing with adjustable phase angle.
 * Rate mode and Heading Hold mode for tail, with gains for each
 * A status LED flashes when gyro is calibrating, and goes out when ready for flight.  If motion is detected when gyro is calibrating, the LED will flash rapidly and the unit will not go into flight mode.  
 * Parameters can be set using serial terminal software that talks to the PhuBar via a USB cable.
 * Optional 8-gram TextStar LCD micro-terminal can be used for field tuning of parameters when you are away from your PC.  The TextStar is powered by the PhuBar – no batteries needed. 
 * Up to 10 different sets of parameters can be stored/retrieved, so you can move the unit among several helicopters, or you can keep settings for different flight regimes.
 * Software detects when the programming cable is connected, and immediately goes into setup mode, with the status LED steady on.  When the cable is disconnected, the unit recalibrates the gyro and returns to flight mode. This makes it unnecessary to disconnect/reconnect the battery to change parameters.
 * An auto-setup feature assists you in assigning gyro axes and servo direction when you install the unit for the first time.
 * Superior vibration rejection through hardware and software filtering, although it still benefits from use of foam tape for mounting.
 * Plenty fast enough for small helis in the 200 size category.


User-changeable parameters include:
 * Angular gain (sometimes called Hiller gain – how strongly the gyro tries to bring heli back to level)
 * Rate Gain (sometimes called damping gain – how strongly the gyro resists quick motions)
 * Angular Decay (simulates the inertia of a weighted physical flybar; the decay value determines how fast the flybar would re-align with the rotor after a change in attitude)
 * Tail Rate gain
 * Tail HH angular gain
 * HH mode on or off
 * HH deadband – How far you have to move the rudder stick to “unlock” the heading hold and move the tail
 * Servo direction reversal 
 * Servo placement on swash – locations from -360 to 360 degrees in 1-degree increments.
 * Gyro axis assignment – allows for 24 different ways for the unit to be mounted on the airframe
 * Gyro axis reversal.
 * Servo pulse interval, from 1 to 20ms in 1ms increments.   This accommodates servos with either fast or slow update rates.
 * Swash Phase Angle from -90 to +90 degrees in 1 degree increments.  Allows emulation of offset head or flybar arrangements, or phase adjustments for 3,4, or 5-blade heads 
 * Swash Ring - 25% to 100% - soft-stop limits on swash tilt to prevent binding
