=*PhuBar*=

PhuBar is a platform for developing stabilizer devices for micro-sized R/C helicopters.  It is based on the Parallax Propeller processor and the ITG-3200 3-axis gyro chip.  It is not intended to be a UAV controller or inertial navigation unit.  It simply provides stabilization similar to that of a physical weighted flybar, making small helicopters easier to fly.
